# Neural Networks
This repo contains 3 IPYNB files, in which, 1 project which is divided into 2 parts, explains the whole intuition about how Neural Networks work by classifying MNIST dataset.
And one project will be Classifying CIFAR dataset.

Classification using Cifar Dataset also explains the use of Softmax Act. function.
